Cardio Vascular Diseases(CVD's) are the main reason for a huge number of deaths in the world over the last few decades and has emerged as the most life-threatening disease.​

There is a need of reliable, accurate and feasible system to diagnose such diseases in time. Using the huge amount of data that the Health care industry produce a disease can be predicted, detected or even cured.​

Machine Learning algorithms, techniques and medical data (Blood pressure, hypertension, cigarettes smoked per day) are used for the prediction of the disease.​

Algorithms used are - K-Nearest Neighbour, Decision Tree, Random Forest.​

In the proposed system various techniques, algorithms and tools are used to create a system which predicts the disease of the patient ​

The dataset and symptoms go to the prediction model of the system where the data is pre-processed for the future references  ​

Then the classification of that data is done with the help of Random Forest algorithm and the data goes in the recommendation model, there it shows the risk analysis that is involved in the system. ​

The structured and unstructured form of data are combined for the overall risk analysis that is required for predicting the disease. ​

Structured analysis is used to identify the chronic disease in a particular region and community. Unstructured analysis is used to select the features automatically with the help of algorithms and techniques.​

ADVANTAGES:​

Random algorithms avoids and prevents overfitting by using multiple trees. ​

This gives accurate and precise results.​
